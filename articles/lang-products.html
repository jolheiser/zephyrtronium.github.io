<a class="permalink" href="#1."><h2 id="1.">I Guess We Do Need Syntax</h2></a>
<p>We established product type (i.e. struct and tuple) syntax quite a few thoughts ago <a href="/articles/lang.html#4.1." target="_blank" rel="noopener">in the exposition</a>.
Let's get around to coming up with a syntax for expressions of product types.</p>
<p>This is actually a bit more involved than for most other programming languages.
We have both &quot;struct&quot; and &quot;tuple&quot; types, but we don't distinguish them syntactically â€“ a tuple is just a struct with field names like <code>.0</code>, <code>.1</code>, &amp;c.</p>
<p>However, we'd still like to be able to construct product values without having to name every field.
The usual <code>(bocchi, ryou)</code> syntax is probably what we want for that.
Simply assign each field in named order.
Then we can do a less-usual extension of that for struct-y syntax, like <code>(.0 = bocchi, .1 = ryou)</code>.</p>
<p>What about products with fields that are inaccessible due to encapsulation?
I think it's preferable to completely disallow the tuple-like syntax there, rather than allowing unexported names to be filled in where they can be inferred.</p>
<p>If we take these spellings for struct and tuple types, then we can easily write function application as <code>f x</code> in the usual functional programming way.
Then if we have inference for tuple literals, we can also write <code>f(bocchi, ryou)</code> to make function application look like the usual <em>procedural</em> way as well.</p>
<p>We also get named arguments for free.
<code>f(bocchi, ryou)</code> would be identical to <code>f(.1 = ryou, .0 = bocchi)</code>, or if <code>f : (* .x: U * .y: V) -&gt; W</code> instead then we can write <code>f(.y = ryou, .x = bocchi)</code>.</p>
<p>Combined with the visibility rule, this does imply that functions generally want to use exported names for their arguments.
It's unusual among programming languages for this to matter.
On the other hand, it implies we have <em>unexported</em> arguments, which prevent calling a function unless those arguments can be supplied some other way.
That idea is pretty intriguing.</p>
<p>An option we can consider to lean into that is to allow intersecting product types.
If <code>x: (*.0: U)</code> and <code>y : V</code>, we allow writing, say, <code>let z = x &amp; (.1 = y)</code> to create <code>z : (*.0: U *.1: V)</code>.
That lets us pass around a tuple representing &quot;partially applied&quot; and possibly unexported arguments to a function, then intersect with a struct of the remaining arguments to finally call it.</p>
<p>Hypothetically, we could even implement closures that way.
Just make them be a pair containing the function to call and its captured variables.
Not sure what that actually buys us, though.
Closures should be easy to write and use, so we'd need syntactic support for treating them this way anyway.</p>
