<a class="permalink" href="#1."><h2 id="1.">Requirements</h2></a>
<p>Let's revisit our <a href="/articles/lang.html#11." target="_blank" rel="noopener">list of wants</a> for dependency management:</p>
<ul>
<li>Package identity must not be tied to location</li>
<li>Namespaces</li>
<li>Fast resolution</li>
<li>Cryptographically signed SBOMs</li>
</ul>
<p>After thinking about it, I do have a couple items of my own to add to this list:</p>
<ul>
<li>Version updates, including new major versions, are easily discoverable</li>
<li><em>Forks</em> are easily discoverable</li>
<li>Repository independence: Git is not the only version control system</li>
</ul>
<p>I want to explicitly add version updates because I think they are a direct technical challenge with the obvious ways to meet SegFault's wishlist.
And while Git is good, it probably won't be the best option forever.
(I still mean to try <a href="https://github.com/martinvonz/jj" target="_blank" rel="noopener">jujutsu</a> at some point.)</p>
<p>Thinking about how to meet these requirements gave me a really very idea.
It is definitely not thoroughly deranged, and I can be trusted with your version updates.</p>
<p>What if we put versions on a blockchain?</p>
<p>To be clear, what I am suggesting has <strong>absolutely nothing to do with cryptocurrency</strong>.
Blockchain is an algorithm.
It's a technical solution that matches up well with certain (very specific) technical problems.
(A Git repository is a kind of blockchain!)
The <a href="https://web3isgoinggreat.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">astonishing harm that comes from cryptocurrency</a> is associated with insistence on using a technical solution for <em>social</em> problems.</p>
<p>So, why blockchain here?
Publishing version updates to a blockchain means we never need any central hosting solution.
Hypothetically, all you need is an internet connection and a cryptographic identity to publish â€“ no one needs to know who you are.
Both finding source locations and checking for updates amount to reductions of the blockchain.
Publishing may be slow, but resolving should be fast once the blockchain is downloaded.
It's easy to choose a representation for nodes that encodes all the other properties we want, as well.</p>


<a class="permalink" href="#2."><h2 id="2.">Seriously??</h2></a>
<p>Ok, you got me.
I think finding potential applications of blockchain that aren't horrifically toxic is fun and interesting.
Is it actually a reasonable solution to versioning and dependency management?
Probably not.</p>
<p>For one thing, consensus is hard.
Any incentive-based consensus algorithm, well, incentivizes people to abuse it.
Probably the most viable approach for what we'd want would be proof-of-authority, which as I understand it amounts to giving a list of who is allowed to append to the blockchain.
Hard to call that decentralized.</p>
<p>And if we don't choose PoA, then whatever &quot;proof&quot; we require to publish can presumably be offered in vast quantities by anyone with enough money.
As just a lil guy, it's almost impossible to prevent supply chain attacks that way.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if we want to make a reasonable effort to enforce the blockchain's use for package versioning, then we likely need every potential verifier to download every potential published version of every package.
That could become a huge amount of traffic.
SourceHut once got to the verge of <a href="https://sourcehut.org/blog/2023-01-09-gomodulemirror/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blocking the Go module proxy</a> over similar concerns.</p>
<p>So, the blockchain is out.
As it almost always should be.</p>
<p>Probably a central service in the style of crates.io, npm, &amp;c. will remain the way to go.
I'd like to find a different solution, but it's hard to imagine one that meets all our goals without tying package identity to package location.</p>

<a class="permalink" href="#3."><h2 id="3.">An aside</h2></a>
<p>As much as I've been enjoying writing Thoughts on a Programming Language, I find myself in a position where I need to prepare for getting a new job.
I'm still converting thoughts I've already written to weblog format, but each one takes multiple hours that I should be spending on practicing my coding challenge pattern recognition.</p>
<p>So, ligma lang is going to have to sit on the shelf for a bit.
I will still try to write thoughts daily, since this is also useful communication practice, but I won't try to publish very often.</p>
