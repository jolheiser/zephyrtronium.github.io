<a class="permalink" href="#1."><h2 id="1.">Modules, or Packages, or Crates, or â€¦</h2></a>
<p>Rust calls it a module; a crate is a collection of modules.
F# calls it a module; an assembly is a collection of modules.
Python calls it a module; a package is a collection of modules.
Go calls it a package; a module is a collection of packages.</p>
<p>?????</p>
<p>So yeah, I have been thinking about the fundamental unit of source code organization for ligma lang.
In particular, I have been thinking about two mutually exclusive ideas with how <em>scope</em> works in the context of this unit of organization.</p>
<p>In Go, with some exceptions, packages are in one-to-one correspondence with directories.
All files in a package can reference all definitions in the package, regardless of where they are.
This includes even defining methods on types in other files, or in the same file but before the type is defined.
And in practice, that actually matters: code generators can be very simple, with no need to understand syntax at all.</p>
<p>F# does almost the opposite.
Modules are individual files (except they can contain nested modules), and you can't make forward references.
That means declaration order matters strongly, and you have to use special tricks to create mutually recursive types.
It also means that a reader can easily find the source of any declaration (if we ignore <code>AutoOpen</code>).
Type checking is also much simpler under this model.</p>


<a class="permalink" href="#2."><h2 id="2.">And Us?</h2></a>
<p>I like both of those approaches.
But, like I said, they're mutually exclusive.</p>
<p>Maybe we can think of a compromise.
We could try the F# approach plus a rule like &quot;modules in the same directory are implicitly imported.&quot;
You'd still have to qualify their names, but we keep the lexical precedence property.</p>
<p>I think we'd also want &quot;modules in the same directory can access each others' <a href="/articles/lang-encapsulation.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unexported identifiers</a>.
E.g., if bocchi.lig and ryou.lig are in the same directoyr, and ryou.lig defines some unexported identifier <code>nijika</code>, then bocchi.lig can write <code>ryou nijika</code> to access it.
And this is without an explicit import of <code>ryou</code>.</p>
<p>This seems a bit verbose, but maybe it's ok.</p>
<p>As for mutually recursive definitions, there are a few options.
Like F#, we could define a keyword that specifically creates a mutually recursive scope.
Honestly, that feels unpleasantly ad hoc to me.</p>
<p>Another option is to simply allow definitions to refer to each other in the same module.
We always type check in multiple passes.
Perhaps a bit more complicated to implement, and we lose strict lexical precedence, but we can at least see when something is defined in the same file.</p>
<p>An option in the opposite direction is to do nothing here, require strict lexical precedence and also provide nothing for mutual recursion.
When you need it, you can simulate it by adding parameters, of either the type or formal variety.
I think that's probably a bit too constricting to work with, but it's plausible.</p>
<p>Honestly, the Go approach holds a lot of draw for me.
It's very easy to <em>just start writing code</em>.
Even though I've felt the penalties of unrestricted reference within a package many times while reading other peoples' code online, I find it very pleasant to actually do work with.</p>
<p>But I think something along the lines of the F# approach is probably <em>better</em>.
I'm still not certain which decision is more correcter.</p>
<p>At the very least, I am convinced that the correct terminology for ligma lang is that a <em>package</em> contains one or more <em>modules</em>.</p>
