<a class="permalink" href="#1."><h2 id="1.">Background</h2></a>
<p>I like Go (even though it's hard to express the constraints I want).
I like Rust (even though it has sickeningly slow compile times).
I like TypeScript (even though the cruft from its less-typed ancestor often shows through).
I like Haskell (even though I don't have quite the education it wants from me).</p>
<p>Yet still, I find myself wanting a better programming language.</p>
<p>For the past few months, I have been thinking about how &quot;a better programming language&quot; would look to me.
Recently, I have started accumulating written notes, ranging from considerations about syntax to musings about whether it's a good idea to use type classes.</p>
<p>Now I've decided to start publishing those notes more visibly on this weblog.
The plan is to continue writing notes, usually short ones, once per day.
If I continue on this plan, eventually there will be enough written down to derive a specification and an implementation or two.</p>
<p>For historical and community reasons, the tentative name for this programming language is ligma lang.
I have ideas for permanent names to use – and I can't deny that ligma is on that list – but for now, that is low on the list of thoughts.</p>
<p>Relative to better programming language designers, my education is a bit unusual.
I have most of an undergraduate computer science degree and half an undergraduate math degree, both sans category theory.
Otherwise, I'm self-taught.
I like to try to use precise terms regardless.
Feel free to correct me if I miss the mark.</p>
<p>The first thing to move here is the summary of design goals.
This list is subject to frequent additions, given how early in the concept I am.</p>


<a class="permalink" href="#2."><h2 id="2.">The Programming Language Is the Developer Experience</h2></a>
<p>The first and most crucial design goal is really a statement of attitude.
Perhaps more precisely, it's a rejection of an attitude I frequently observe.</p>
<p><em>We need to stop treating programming languages as compilers.</em></p>
<p>Or interpreters, as it were.
Even at a very narrow scope, treating a programming language as its implementation is perilous.</p>
<p>Consider Rust, a major programming language currently having no formal specification.
<a href="https://rust-gcc.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rust-gcc</a>, the in-progress GCC frontend for Rust, is three and a half years deep with over 1100 contributors.
It <em>still</em> does not implement Rust.</p>
<p>Contrast with Go, which has been a specification-first language almost since its conception.
One of the core Go team members, Ian Lance Taylor, famously joined the project by simply showing up with gccgo, before the language was even v1.</p>
<p>That said, there's more to this idea than just what can go wrong.
One of the features I find most intriguing about Zig is built-in syntactic support for tests.
Functionally, it isn't really different from what Go, Rust, or most other languages do for automated tests.
Between the lines, it shows that Zig understands that testing is a core piece of the operations of a software developer.</p>
<p>There's more to the idea of considering the developer experience holistically, too.
I'm imagining a language which opts for semantic versioning <em>semantically</em>.
The language should help you determine when your API changes and you need a version bump.</p>
<p>Tests should be first-class.
Tooling from code style to static analysis should be first-class.
A language server should be first-class, probably one of the first programs written in any serious programming language being designed in 2024.</p>
<p>The prime directive of ligma lang is this statement:
the programming language is the developer experience.</p>


<a class="permalink" href="#3."><h2 id="3.">Structured Concurrency</h2></a>
<p>Structured concurrency is the idea of tying the lifetimes of threads to lexical scopes.
Roughly speaking, for any starting point of a thread, you can find the stopping point just by scanning the code – even if you don't know the types or even the language you're reading.
An excellent and very detailed introduction to structured concurrency is njs's <a href="https://vorpus.org/blog/notes-on-structured-concurrency-or-go-statement-considered-harmful/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Go Statement Considered Harmful</a>.</p>
<p>By no means is structured concurrency a new idea.
If you've worked much with frontend development, you've probably used something like <code>Promise.all</code> or one of the other Promise methods.
Given a bit of leeway in the definition, that's an implementation of structured concurrency:
for every promise in the argument list, you know that it is completed by the time the result promise of <code>Promise.all</code> is awaited (or chained with <code>.then</code>).</p>
<p>Rust has scoped threads.
Zig has async frames.
I know that Kotlin has strong support as well, although I don't know the details.
For languages that don't have structured concurrency built in, it's usually straightforward to implement as a library.
E.g., Go has <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/sync/errgroup" target="_blank" rel="noopener">x/sync/errgroup</a> and <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/sourcegraph/conc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sourcegraph/conc</a>, among others.</p>
<p>The thing I find surprising is that there still doesn't seem to be a language which has <em>only</em> structured concurrency.
Everyone still insists on allowing unrestricted concurrency.
That defeats the entire point of having structured concurrency at all.</p>
<p>So, the second goal of ligma lang is to provide such a language.
If you see a point where a coroutine is created, you can see a point where it exits.
It might involve following around a few functions, but you can do it without understanding the exact types involved.</p>


<a class="permalink" href="#4."><h2 id="4.">Types are the Core</h2></a>
<p>Types are safety.
To one degree or another, type systems let us prove correctness of our software systems without ever needing to execute them.
So, programmers <em>should</em> use types.
I believe that things programmers <em>should</em> do should be <em>easy</em> to do.</p>
<p>Let's say we want to define a type representing a 3D point with integer coordinates.
Let's say we <s>want to</s> do so in Java.</p>
<pre><code>public class Point3D {
    private int x, y, z;

    public Point3D(int x, int y, int z) {
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
        this.z = z;
    }

    public int getX() {
        return this.x;
    }

    public void setX(int x) {
        this.x = x;
    }

    // aaaaaaaaa
}
</code></pre>
<p>How much syntax does it take to write this?
How much <em>time</em> does it take?
Defining even the simplest possible types is incredibly heavyweight here.
The more precisely you want to model your domain in types – in <em>provable correctness</em> – the more heavily you're penalized.</p>
<p>Now let's say that we want to write a type that expresses either an integer or a string.
How do we write that in Java? ...Can we?</p>
<p>The 3D point example is what we in tha bidness call a <em>product type</em>.
The usual names for product types are structs, tuples, sometimes arrays, and so on.
Roughly speaking, they're products because the number of possible values it has is the product of the number of possible values of its constituents.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the &quot;integer or string&quot; example is a <em>coproduct type</em>.
More familiar names might be unions (if you're a C or C++ programmer), enums (if you're a Rust programmer), sum types (if you're an ML programmer), or <a href="https://go.dev/issue/19412" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#19412</a> (if you feel a twinge of nostalgia when writing Go).
They're &quot;co-&quot; products because they have a deep relationship with product types, together forming a special kind of mathematical structure.
I'll usually refer to them as sum types, which are technically a particular variety of coproduct, but I think sufficient for my vision.</p>
<p>I feel that products and sums are foundational to programming.
Moreover, they are <em>equally fundamental</em>.
There is no reason to elevate products above sums; they both arise frequently in domain modeling.</p>
<p>Since both products and sums are equal, they should have similar cost to express in syntax.
Since both are important, both should be easy to use.
Defining a new type of either variety should come naturally.
F# and TypeScript come very close to doing what I want here.
Ligma lang can still do better.</p>

<a class="permalink" href="#4.1."><h3 id="4.1.">Bonus: Type Syntax</h3></a>
<p>Given the importance of product and sum types, I've landed already on how I think the syntax for defining them should look.
Here's an example.</p>
<pre><code>​// .Null demonstrates a product type.
type .Null(T: type) =
    * .Value: T
    * .Exists: bool

​// .Maybe demonstrates a sum type.
​// Note ** is the unit type.
type .Maybe(T: type) =
    / .None: **
    / .Some: T

​// .Pair demonstrates a product type with &quot;numeric&quot; column names, like a tuple.
​// It works because the . character always introduces an identifier.
type .Pair(Fst: type, Snd: type) =
    * .0: Fst
    * .1: Snd

​// bool demonstrates a sum type with distinct variants of the same type.
type bool = / false: ** / true: **
</code></pre>
<p>There are a number of details here that I'll save for another day to explain.
The important thing is that both products and sums are expressed using lists with unary prefix operators to introduce each element.
The product type syntax in EBNF is <code>{ '*' ident ':' Type }</code>.
The sum type syntax is <code>{ '/' ident ':' Type }</code>.
Both tremendously lightweight. Both equal in cost.</p>


<a class="permalink" href="#4.2."><h3 id="4.2.">Polymorphism</h3></a>
<p>Note that the syntax example makes plenty of use of <code>type</code>-typed parameters.
That part of the syntax is definitely not firm yet, but the intent of providing parametric polymorphism – functions and types that takes types as inputs to describe their values – certainly is.</p>
<p>While it is possibly less firm of a goal, I'm curious how it would go to have <em>only</em> parametric polymorphism.
It's very common for programming languages today to provide subtype polymorphism, roughly corresponding to what most programmers think of as inheritance or interface satisfaction, but I want to avoid it if possible.</p>
<p>Rust mostly relies on parametric polymorphism with its trait system, but dyn traits provide an escape into subtype polymorphism.
Haskell uses parametric and ad hoc polymorphism, or function overloading, without subtypes.
For most of its life, Go provided only subtype polymorphism (interfaces).</p>
<p>Regardless of whether subtype polymorphism makes it in, there will need to be some mechanism to express bounds or constraints on type parameters.
Rust and (to an extent) Go use the same device for bounds as they do for subtypes.
I think that's a strong insight.</p>



<a class="permalink" href="#5."><h2 id="5.">There Are No Zero Cost Abstractions</h2></a>
<p>Rust and other languages are enamored with the concept of <em>zero cost abstractions</em>.
These are abstractions, in the program modularization sense, which don't cause the executed program to increase in size or computation steps.</p>
<p>Uniformly, &quot;zero cost abstractions&quot; <em>move</em> the cost to compilation time.
Somehow, Rust programmers have concluded that a software developer's time spent waiting for their program to compile –
perhaps before production deployment, perhaps before unit testing, perhaps before submitting a university assignment that is due in four minutes –
is not a cost.</p>
<p>I have many things that I want to do.
There are very few things more valuable to me than my time.
My compiler should not be consuming all of it.</p>
<p>The real goal here is that the compiler should be fast.
More precisely, the language should not get in the way of the compiler being fast.
However, that <em>directly</em> implies that abstractions are not implemented through expensive static analysis.</p>


<a class="permalink" href="#6."><h2 id="6.">And Other Consequences of Prioritizing Compiler Speed</h2></a>
<p>Zero cost abstractions aren't the only thing we're giving up.
As fascinating as I find dependent types, having the compiler execute arbitrary user-supplied code is definitely a no-go.</p>
<p>Other constraints for the sake of compiler speed are even more limiting.
There probably should not be any mechanism for recursion in types.
I'm not sure whether that excludes higher-kinded types in general.</p>


<a class="permalink" href="#7."><h2 id="7.">No Reflection, No RTTI</h2></a>
<p>This goal is a bit less firm than most of the others, but I think it would be a big win for a type-oriented language.
The idea is to minimize the cost of defining types by ensuring they are completely irrelevant to the final compiled program.
That means there is no facility for reflection and not even any automatically generated type information.</p>
<p>This is one of the main reasons for avoiding subtype polymorphism as mentioned above.
While not necessarily crucial, I think most programmers who understand subtype polymorphism want to be able to specialize for particular dynamic types.
But in order to do that, we need at least some sense of type identity.
Type identities can become expensive if we are encouraging defining many types.</p>
<p>Reflection enables some very powerful programs.
In Go, it's the de facto approach to almost all serialization.
Java and C# do fascinating things with reflection information.</p>
<p>In other words, if we're going to forgo reflection, then we need powerful solutions to these problems.
Encoding to JSON is a plenty common operation that programmers <em>should</em> do, so following the rule from before, it should be simple to do.
Unforunately, I don't have many solid thoughts on this front yet.</p>


<a class="permalink" href="#8."><h2 id="8.">System ABI</h2></a>
<p>Platform interop, especially with C code, matters.
This is yet another thing that (regardless of anyone's feelings on the matter) is going to be common.
So, it should be simple.</p>
<p>Ideally, at least in a sense, we should be able to call C code without much more information than that it is C code.
Rendering to a desktop window, or executing a Vulkan render pipeline, &amp;c. really should not carry the cost that it does in languages like Go that define their own special ABIs.
We want to isolate platform code in types, but not make it tremendously awkward to use it.</p>


<a class="permalink" href="#9."><h2 id="9.">Featureful Standard Library</h2></a>
<p>While the Rust approach of providing a minimal core of features and allowing alternative implementations of the basics allows for some fascinating projects, I don't think it's a good ideal for <em>most</em> programming languages.
That's really the realm of languages which seek to be used at the lowest level of systems programming.
Not quite what I have in mind for ligma lang.</p>
<p>I think Go has an almost perfect standard library.
There are maybe a few things it has that it probably shouldn't, but it's tremendously powerful without being an unmanageable amount of code on its own.</p>


<a class="permalink" href="#10."><h2 id="10.">Isolation</h2></a>
<p>The idea here is that if some piece of code <code>bocchi</code> depends on another piece of code <code>ryou</code>, then a change to only <code>bocchi</code> must never require us to recompile <code>ryou</code>.
This seems like a straightforward idea, but it has surprisingly deep implications, especially while we avoid reflection and RTTI.</p>


<a class="permalink" href="#11."><h2 id="11.">Dependency Management</h2></a>
<p>The very first claim was that ligma lang must address the developer experience holistically.
Though perhaps furthest from the core of the language itself, dependency management is an important part of that.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/SegFaultAX" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SegFaultAX</a> is the main proponent of this goal, so I'll leave this as a summary of his wants:</p>
<ul>
<li>Package identity must not be tied to location</li>
<li>Namespaces</li>
<li>Fast resolution</li>
<li>Cryptographically signed SBOMs</li>
</ul>
