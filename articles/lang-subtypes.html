<a class="permalink" href="#1."><h2 id="1.">Dynamic Dispatch</h2></a>
<p>I discussed the tension between subtype polymorphism and runtime type information (RTTI) in <a href="/articles/lang.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the exposition</a>.
While I'm interested in seeing the results of a language with only parametric polymorphism, I do have some thoughts on how to introduce subtyping, or something resembling it, without requiring RTTI.</p>
<p>The first thing we want is <em>dynamic dispatch</em>, the ability to respond to a message to one static type which selects behavior depending an arbitrary dynamic type according to the construction of the value.
Normally this is done by having the supertype include a vtable, a list of function pointers which the subtype fills out with its own implementations.
That's easy to do without RTTI, and even to some extent without language support; see Zig.</p>
<p>The second thing we want is <em>specialization</em>.
Here that's basically just the ability to inspect the dynamic type of a supertype variable and write our own local code that varies with it, without requiring the subtype to provide the specialized behavior we want.
This is much harder to do without RTTI, but it can often be important especially for performance reasons.</p>
<p>That kind of specialization also violates <em>parametricity</em>, a property arising from viewing types as relations that allows us to derive proofs about code &quot;for free.&quot;
Parametricity is extremely powerful, but it requires some strong assumptions about the type system.
Meeting those assumptions in ligma lang could have great advantages for testing and optimization.</p>


<a class="permalink" href="#2."><h2 id="2.">Sealed Hierarchies; Or, Sum Types</h2></a>
<p>Scala, Kotlin, and soon even Java have the concept of <em>sealed hierarchies</em>.
We provide the definition of some extensible type, but then provide a complete, closed list of all of its subtypes.
We can't add any new subtypes without modifying the definition of the supertype.</p>
<p>It's pretty obvious to see how we can implement a sealed hierarchy without RTTI.
Rather than hold a descriptor of which dynamic type is in use, we only need to enumerate the types in the hierarchy and track the index into that enumeration.</p>
<p>We can do a very similar thing using the sum types that we already want.
It seems like all we really need is a rule like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A property shared by every variant of a sum type is promoted to the sum type itself and dispatches dynamically.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here I'm using &quot;property&quot; to refer to any named thing on a type, be it a field or a method, along with the type of the result it produces.
If it's the same on every variant, then we can do dynamic dispatch trivially.
While I don't yet have ideas for method syntax, we can look at some examples with product type fields.</p>
<pre><code>​// .PromotedX has a promoted accessor .x of type int.
​// Every variant is a product type with that field.
type .PromotedX =
    / .1: (* .x: int)
    / .2: (* .x: int, * .y: int)

​// .NotPromotedX has no promoted accessors.
​// The types of the .x fields disagree between variants.
type .NotPromotedX =
    / .1: (* .x: int)
    / .2: (* .x: string)

​// .NothingToPromote has no promoted accessors.
​// There are no properties with the same name.
type .NothingToPromote =
    / .1: (* .x: int)
    / .2: (* .y: int)
</code></pre>
<p>And again, we only need to know an index into a list to implement this.
No RTTI needed. Not even type identities.</p>
<p>With this approach, we even keep parametricity while enabling specialization.
We aren't really specializing on a type per se, but rather specializing on a variant of a type.</p>
<p>This idea is like backward nominal subtyping.
Instead of a bunch of types declaring themselves to be subtypes of the supertype, we have a type declaring itself to be the supertype of a bunch of subtypes.</p>
<p>Well, strictly speaking, this isn't subtyping at all.
We have to explicitly construct the sum-typed value using the variant of our choice, rather than directly using the subtype in place of the supertype.
For practical purposes, I think it's close enough.</p>
<p>Speaking of practical purposes, does this rule really provide what we want out of subtype polymorphism?
It seems obviously fine for mocking, as long as we can reasonably provide a mock of every property of the real implementation.
Strategy pattern also seems like it would work fine here.</p>
<p>But obviously, that isn't an exhaustive list of the places subtype polymorphism is useful.
I'm curious where it falls short.
If there are places where sum types aren't good enough, then maybe we can take the approach Zig uses:
Make the programmer implement their own vtables.
As long as we have product types and closures, it's viable.</p>


<a class="permalink" href="#3."><h2 id="3.">Dual</h2></a>
<p>It's vaguely interesting to think about the dual of the sum type rule, i.e. the rule we'd apply to product types instead.
It would go something like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Any property on exactly one field of a product type is promoted to the product type itself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think this is probably a bad rule, although it may show up again in a later note.
Maybe it would be more useful – and less bad – than I think.</p>


<a class="permalink" href="#4."><h2 id="4.">Still Lacking</h2></a>
<p>This approach definitely doesn't actually meet our needs, but ironically, the problem doesn't have anything to do with subtype polymorphism itself.</p>
<p>I mentioned in the exposition that both Rust and Go use the same construct to express both subtype polymorphism and bounds in parametric polymorphism.
Rust uses traits and dyn traits; Go uses interfaces with generalizations for generics.
I think that's a good approach.</p>
<p>If our subtype polymorphism approach is &quot;don't,&quot; then we need a different way to express bounds.
I still don't have any idea of how that should look.</p>
