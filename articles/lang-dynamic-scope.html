<a class="permalink" href="#1."><h2 id="1.">Dynamic Scope</h2></a>
<p>Dynamic scope means a function is allowed to access local variables of its callers.
Sounds only very terrifying, doesn't it?</p>
<p>Well, let's walk it back a bit.
Dynamic scope can also require those callers to have provided the variables the callee can access.
The WithValue parts of Go's <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/context#WithValue" target="_blank" rel="noopener">context.Context</a> are an example of this.
Vue and presumably other frontend frameworks have <a href="https://vuejs.org/guide/components/provide-inject.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">provide and inject</a>.
That makes it somewhat more reasonable.</p>
<p>I think dynamic scope could be even better, though.
Ligma lang can make it statically typed.</p>
<p>For us to pull this off, a function's type must indicate the transitive closure of dynamically scoped fields it will use.
That means if <code>bocchi</code> depends on <code>ryou</code> and we change <code>ryou</code> to start using dynamically scoped <code>pacifica</code>, then <code>bocchi</code>'s type also changes to reflect that.
Making this be inferred rather than explicitly typed by the programmer is crucial.</p>
<p>This idea is a kind of <em>effect system</em>, which is like a parallel to a type system for describing visible changes to the outside world incurred by a function.
Recognizing this fact means that we can apply research on effect systems to understand what we can do.</p>
<p>It so happens that <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.2061.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this paper on Koka's row-polymorphic effects</a> describes almost exactly what we want for dynamic scope.</p>
<p>Although, unlike that paper, we do require the effects to be ordered by insertion in addition to being multiple.
That lets <code>bocchi</code> replace the value of <code>pacifica</code> before it calls <code>ryou</code> without affecting <code>kita</code>'s call to <code>ryou</code>.
When a function adds to dynamic scope, it always pops off the most recent entry for that field when it returns.</p>
<p>In part as a result of that change, we also don't need closed rows.
There's no reason to allow encoding &quot;this function must not be provided a <code>bocchi</code> in its dynamic scope.&quot;
If a function doesn't want <code>bocchi</code>, it simply doesn't read <code>bocchi</code>.
If we want to replace the value of <code>bocchi</code> for another callee, then we just do that.</p>
<p>Recognizing dynamic scope as an effect system also gives us some interesting powers.
If <code>bocchi</code>'s callees (transitively) require <code>pacifica</code>, and <code>bocchi</code> always provides <code>pacifica</code>, then <code>bocchi</code> <em>eliminates</em> the &quot;requires <code>pacifica</code> effect.
The requirement disappears from <code>bocchi</code>'s type.
Effect inference can handle that for us automatically.</p>
<p>It also gives us some guidance about closures.
If <code>bocchi</code> takes <code>ryou</code> as an argument, then <code>bocchi</code> needs to add the dynamic scope required by <code>ryou</code> to its own (except possibly those fields it eliminates, as above).
Since effects are captured in <code>bocchi</code>'s type, that means the type of <code>bocchi</code> depends on the dynamic scope of any closure it's passed.
Hence, polymorphism of the row variety.</p>


<a class="permalink" href="#2."><h2 id="2.">And Structured Concurrency</h2></a>
<p>Given that structured concurrency lets us assign a type to collections of concurrent operations, we might wonder whether there's an interaction between it and dynamic scope.
For example, what happens when <code>bocchi</code> is given a concurrency lifetime to add new coroutines to, but injects a new <code>pacifica</code> before spawning <code>ryou</code> in that lifetime?</p>
<p>This, too, is fine.
There must be a reference to <code>pacifica</code> in the dynamic scope <em>somewhere</em>.</p>
<p>Either <code>bocchi</code> provides it for the first time, in which case it eliminates the effect, or <code>bocchi</code> requires it, so the function that adds <code>bocchi</code> to the lifetime in the first place also either provides or requires it.
The effect propagates exactly as far back as it needs to, even if concurrency is involved.
It might go as far back to the creation of the concurrent lifetime, or further, but it's allowed to do that.
In a sense, that's the point of structured concurrency.</p>
<p>Though, practically, at least with how I'm imagining the implementation, there might be a performance penalty with that situation.</p>
