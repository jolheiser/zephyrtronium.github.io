<a class="permalink" href="#1."><h2 id="1.">1 + T</h2></a>
<p>The Maybe or Option type is the simplest parametric sum type.
For any given type, it adds exactly one additional value.
Hence, <code>1 + T</code> for some arbitrary type T.</p>
<p>The usual interpretation is that there is either <code>Some</code> value of type T, or <code>None</code>; or <code>Just</code> a value or <code>Nothing</code>.
The particular names depend on your heritage.
I learned Haskell before Rust or any ML, so I tend to prefer the Maybe/Just/Nothing trio.
(But I've also written more Rust than Haskell, so I sometimes switch to Option/Some/None, or annoyingly mix Just and None. Oh well. All of it means the same thing.)</p>
<p>Using the sum type (and unit type) syntax we established in <a href="/articles/lang.html#4.1." target="_blank" rel="noopener">the exposition</a>, we can define ligma lang's Maybe type roughly as follows:</p>
<pre><code>type .Maybe(T: type) =
    / .Nothing: **
    / .Some: T
</code></pre>
<p>But I think this approach is a mistake.
The idea of &quot;possibly absent value&quot; is incredibly prevalent in computing.
It's something that programmers <em>should</em> do very often.
So, it should be <em>very easy</em> to do.</p>
<p>The syntax I like happens to be almost exactly what Zig has.
For any type <code>T</code>, we can create a <code>Maybe T</code> by writing <code>?T</code>.
A single character as a prefix operator for arguably the most important type constructor.</p>
<p>There are some things I'd like <code>?T</code> to do that Zig doesn't provide, though.
A very important insight from the land of functional programming is that <code>Maybe T</code> is a <em>monad</em>.
It's a wrapper around some context that allows us to perform computations that change with the context.</p>
<p>In essentially all functional programming languages, one can <em>bind</em> functions that take a T and return a U onto a <code>Maybe T</code>.
If the Maybe is <code>Some x</code>, then <code>x</code> goes into the function as an input, and the result of type U is <em>lifted</em> back into the world of Maybes to become a <code>Maybe U</code>.
If it's <code>Nothing</code> instead, then the function is ignored and the result remains <code>Nothing</code>.</p>
<p>I want that binding capability for ligma lang, but again, it's something too important not to have extremely simple syntax.
Zig wants you to explicitly inspect the optional using <code>if (m) |someValue|</code> (or correspondingly <code>while</code>).
Haskell lets you use <code>do</code> syntax, which gives the programmer a &quot;procedural&quot; sublanguage that is really just repeated binding on each result.</p>
<p>What I want in ligma lang is this rule:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If <code>T</code> has a property <code>x</code> of type <code>U</code>, then <code>?T</code> has a property <code>x</code> of type <code>?U</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is, I want monadic binding on the optional type to be implicit.
As usual, I'm using &quot;property&quot; to mean &quot;field or method&quot; (assuming we have methods).
In the latter case, this would also imply that optional closures bind application as well.</p>
<p>I still haven't actually landed on syntax for <code>Just x</code> and <code>Nothing</code>.
Those terms I think are still a bit long-winded for how frequent they should be.
A cute idea would be to write <code>&lt;x&gt;</code> and <code>&gt;&lt;</code>.
Maybe (hehe) that's a bit too unusual, but I'll roll with it for now.</p>
<p>There also should be some sense of narrowing, i.e. the ability to recover the <code>x</code> in <code>&lt;x&gt;</code> in bound code.
In most languages with Maybe or Option, you'd use pattern matching to do that.
No specific ideas for ligma lang yet, considering I'm not even sure what functions should look like.</p>


<a class="permalink" href="#2."><h2 id="2.">1 + 1</h2></a>
<p>Now for a much less certain idea.</p>
<p>The unit type, which in ligma lang we write as <code>**</code>, has exactly one value.
(Think &quot;unit&quot; as in &quot;unity&quot;.)
The Maybe type constructor takes an arbitrary type and adds exactly one additional value to it.
That means that <code>?**</code>, the optional unit type, has exactly two values.</p>
<p>There's another extremely important type that has exactly two values: bool, being either true or false.
That means we could <em>define</em> <code>type bool = ?**</code>, along with making <code>false</code> mean <code>(&gt;&lt; as ?**)</code> (or whatever syntax) and <code>true</code> mean <code>&lt;**&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>In combination with implicit binding of function application, we get an interesting property from using this definition.
Applying a function to <code>true</code> executes that function, and applying it to <code>false</code> doesn't.
We've uncovered lambda calculus, kind of!
We do need some syntax for the &quot;else&quot; part of conditional execution, though.</p>
<p>Note that defining bool this way implies that we need a special definition of equality for <code>?**</code> separate from the implicitly promoted equality on <code>**</code>.
Otherwise we'd have <code>false == false</code> evaluate to <code>false</code> and <code>true == true</code> evaluate to <code>&lt;true&gt;</code>.
And the fact that we need special equality for <code>?**</code> suggests that we should have it for <code>?T</code> wherever <code>T</code> has equality.
And the fact that we should have it for <code>?T</code> suggests that if we have type constructors then we should have the ability to do it for any type constructor.
And now we're basically at type classes.</p>
<p>I'm not sure whether ligma lang will have general type constructors.
(I strongly want to avoid allowing recursion in types in consideration of compilation speed, but my understanding is that System F<sub>Ï‰</sub> is fine in that regard.)
This will be a topic to revisit when that decision is made.</p>
