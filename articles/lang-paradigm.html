<a class="permalink" href="#1."><h2 id="1.">Surprise</h2></a>
<p>I'm not actually decided on what programming paradigm ligma lang should be.</p>
<p>I like functional programming, because I like writing proofs, solving puzzles, and generalizing things.
It's certainly less accessible to most developers than procedural programming, though.
Ligma lang is &quot;the language I wish I were writing,&quot; and me writing it is predicated on it being used.</p>
<p>So, I think that ligma lang at least has loops and first-class mutability.
Although, this brings me to a tangent that I think about often.</p>


<a class="permalink" href="#2."><h2 id="2.">Functional Programming is a Paradigm</h2></a>
<p>There seems to be a prevalent notion that functional programming means programming where closures exist and probably everything is immutable.
You use functions like map, reduce, and filter over lists and assume that the compiler will optimize everything how you want.
Hence, languages like Rust and JavaScript which have map, reduce, and filter have &quot;functional features.&quot;</p>
<p>To me, this is like saying, &quot;Chinese is like English except you write Hanzi instead of Latin letters, and sometimes Chinese even borrows from English.&quot;
It's entirely missing the point.</p>
<p>Functional programming is a <em>paradigm</em>.
Haskell is as different from Rust as general relativity is from quantum physics.
It isn't just a different <em>approach</em> to programming, it's a different <em>foundation</em> to programming.</p>
<p>Moderately educated programmers generally seem to be aware that functional programming inherits from lambda calculus.
What they don't usually seem to be aware of is that in (untyped or simply typed) lambda calculus, there is <em>nothing</em> that is not a function.</p>
<p><code>true</code> is the function <code>true(x) ↦ (g(y) ↦ x)</code>, i.e. &quot;true takes <code>x</code> and evaluates to a function which takes <code>y</code> and returns <code>x</code>.&quot;
(The symbol ↦ is read &quot;maps to.&quot; Think &quot;map&quot; roughly as in &quot;hash map&quot; here.)
Note that the <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> that <code>true</code> and its computed closure take <em>are also functions</em>.</p>
<p>3 is the function <code>3(f) ↦ (g(x) ↦ f(f(f(x))))</code>, or &quot;3 takes an <code>f</code> and evaluates to a new function that composes <code>f</code> three times.&quot;
I could specify that <code>f</code> has to be a function in order to be so composed, but there's nothing else it could be.
Lambda calculus <em>only</em> has functions.</p>
<p>Granted, most functional programming languages are derived from extensions to simply typed lambda calculus that add ideas which cannot be described purely as functions.
I think it's more precise to describe functional programming languages as those <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOiZatlZtGU" target="_blank" rel="noopener">founded on systems of logic</a>.</p>
<p>When I think about functional programming, I think about lambda calculus, logic, and category theory.
I don't think about map, reduce, and filter.
Those are just structures that arise when considering computation from this foundation.</p>
<p>I like to call the &quot;everything is immutable, but not everything is purely a logical structure&quot; approach of languages like Erlang, Elixir, or Gleam <em>immutable programming</em>.
They share with functional programming the characteristic that everything is immutable, but that's about where the similarities end.</p>


<a class="permalink" href="#3."><h2 id="3.">Immutable Programming is Good</h2></a>
<p>Even given all my whining in the previous section, I still think immutable programming is a good idea.
In fact, I'd rather make ligma lang immutable rather than truly functional.
Frankly, in a world dominated by OOPlets, functional programming is… inaccessible.</p>
<p>Compared to procedural or object-oriented programming, immutable programming can help to reduce complexity in software systems.
If you believe <a href="https://curtclifton.net/papers/MoseleyMarks06a.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Moseley and Marks</a>, this follows from its property of isolating accidental state.</p>
<p>It's still <em>possible</em> to encode &quot;mutable memory&quot; by passing a collection to every function, replacing elements of the collection as needed.
Doing that generally takes much more effort compared to mutable variables, though.
This is one of ligma lang's design principles: since it's something programmers <em>shouldn't</em> do, it should be <em>harder</em> to do.</p>


<a class="permalink" href="#4."><h2 id="4.">Which Paradigm, Though?</h2></a>
<p>I still feel ligma lang should have first-class mutability.
Sometimes mutable variables are crucial to performance optimization, in particular because it semantically maps well to how actual hardware works.
It should be harder than staying with immutable values, though, just like it is in Rust with the <code>mut</code> keyword.</p>
<p>Totally eschewing mutability would hypothetically allow us to target BEAM, which would be nice for a few reasons.
It's a very impressive platform with a featureful ecosystem, and its concurrency support would probably simplify the runtime implementation of ligma lang's structured concurrency.</p>
<p>But, I think we can still achieve most of the advantages of immutable programming using just types, without precluding the kind of high-performance (or sometimes just interoperable-with-C) code that really makes languages suited to authoring world-class services.
And luckily, between my experience keeping up to date with Go's compiler and runtime and my fairly systems-oriented formal education, I do have a good idea of how to implement the things I want.</p>
<p>So, I think ligma lang is a strongly typed procedural language that features closures.</p>
